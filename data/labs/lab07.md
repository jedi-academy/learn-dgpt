# Lab #7 - Handling Input
COMP4711 - BCIT/DGPT - Fall 2019

## Lab Goals

We need to come up with, and apply, some input validation
rules for the travel places editor.

## Lab Submission

Submit a readme *text* file, or a submission comment, to the lab dropbox. 
It should contain your github username. I can find the repositories from
the starter project forks.

Due: this Sunday at 17:30

A marking rubric will be attached to the dropbox.

## What to do?

1. Add a handling method to your controller, and bind the form to it

2. In the handler, show (echo, var_dump, ...) the input you receive

3. Setup validation rules, something for each field (to discuss in class)

4. Apply validation, redisplaying the form (with error messages) if errors

5. Display a "success" view if no errors --> redisplay the list
