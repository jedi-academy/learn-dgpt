# Lab #7 - Distributed transport glue
COMP4711 - BCIT - Winter 2019

## Lab Goals

Experiment time!

The purpose of this lab is to make sure that your app can handle
pretty much anything "thrown" at it, and that it can emit the
right stuff for another RESTful service.

My ultimate goal is a RESTFilter, which can handle "all the things"
and make sure that key/value pairs passed to a RESTful server
can be extracted regardless. Your work and findings will help
shape that.

## Lab Teams

I have setup a new set of "Lab07" teams of two for this,
although you are free to work on your own. You may partner with the
same person as the earlier labs, if you like, but don't have to.

You will need to join one of the lab 7 groups, even if working on your own.

## Lab Submission

Submit your Client and Server controllers, and a readme file,
to the lab dropbox. Initial submission is to be before
the end of lab, i.e. 12:20, and you are free to modify it
until Sunday at 17:30.

A marking rubric will be attached to the dropboxes.

## What to do?

I will go over specifics in class.
