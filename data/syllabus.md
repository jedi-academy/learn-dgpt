## Course description
This course provides the students with an opportunity to develop a software 
application that works across the internet. An overview of various internet 
software development technologies is provided. 
Students will learn how to build a web application using a modern webapp 
MVC framework and Apache server technology; and how to use XML for data 
representation, structure and transport. 

## Course goals
This course is about webapp development, using best practices.  
In small teams, the students will build a robust RESTful webapp backend, 
to complement their option projects.  
The teams will collaborate using a shared code repository and gitflow workflow, 
with appropriate supporting tools.  

## Course learning outcomes / competencies
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:  

1  Build a moderate MVC web application using a suitable framework.  
	1.1  Setup a suitable webapp development environment  
	1.2  Build a basic RESTish webapp backend  
	1.3  Build a moderately complex RESTful webapp backend  
2  Build distributed capabilities into an MVC web application  
	2.1  Use common representation protocols for distributed systems  
	2.2  Use common transport protocols for distributed systems  
	2.3  Use common application protocols for distributed systems  
3  Demonstrate proper team collaboration for webapp development  
	3.1  Use collaborative workflow to develop a webapp  
	3.2  Use a shared code repository to develop a webapp  


## Evaluation criteria
Quizzes & participation - 10% ... Readings & lab attendance (motivation)  
Labs - 40% ... Walkthrough labs (guidance)  
Assignments - 30% ... 2 assignments (practice)  
Final exam - 20% ... Final project - third assignment (assessment)

## Attendance requirements
Attendance is mandatory. In case of illness or other unavoidable cause of absence,
