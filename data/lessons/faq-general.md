# Frequently Asked Questions - General
COMP4711 - BCIT - Fall 2017

This FAQ addresses the most common problems encountered
trying to develop webapps as part of this course.

##CIT GIT server
The CIT GitLab server that I mentioned to a few students in class
is at https://git.cit.bcit.ca

Feel free to register for an account there, using your my.bcit.ca email
address, if you are concerned about personal information stored on
servers outside our control.


##Email Cautions

If you send an email from inside D2L, it cannot be responded to.
D2L is a notification only service, which tries to look like an email service.
Use your & our real email addresses instead.

If you encounter a problem with your lab, and I ask you to email
me a zip of the project folder (so we don't mess up your repo) and of
your Apache config, the institute email server is likely to remove the zip
attachments, for security :( Workaround - make them, put them in a dropbox, and
include the dropbox link in your email.
