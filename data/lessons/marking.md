#Marking Process
COMP4711 - BCIT - Winter 2019

I thought I would share with you the marking scripts that I use
for submissions.


## Early-Course Marking (before using a DB)

This is the marking script I use in the beginning of the course,
before your apps start using a database. I copy the repo link provided by you
and invoke the script with it as a parameter ($1 below).

    # Script to pull a student repo down into the marking directory
    # it is then opened in NB, the repo is opened, and the webapp is "run" in the browser
    cd /pub7/htdocs
    rm -rf comp4711
    mkdir comp4711
    cd comp4711
    git init
    git pull -f $1.git master
    cd ..
    firefox $1
    firefox comp4711.local
    # /usr/local/netbeans-8.0.2/bin/netbeans --open /pub7/htdocs/comp4711

The script basically pulls your repo into an empty folder on my system,
which I have pre-configured for the `comp4711.local` virtual host.
It  then opens up your Github repo in one browser tab, and runs your
app in a second browser tab.

## Mid-Course Marking (with a DB)

Once we start using an RDB, I switch to the following script.

    #!/bin/bash
    #------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Script to pull a student repo down into the marking directory.
    # It is then opened in NB, the repo is opened, and the webapp is "run" in the browser
    #
    # Usage: ./mark.sh repo-name [branch [commit-hash]]
    #------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    if [ "$1" = "" ]; then
            echo "Usage: ./mark.sh repo-name [branch [commit-hash]]"
            exit 1
    fi
    # configuration pulled in from "myconfig", for better security
    source myconfig

    # Where are we working? (ps - this should be where this script lives)
    cd $htdocs

    repo=$1				# repo name to pull from

    # branch to pull (assume master)
    if [ "$2" = "" ]; then 
            branch='master'
    else 
            branch=$2
    fi

    echo "********************************************************************"
    echo "Marking $1 $branch"
    echo "********************************************************************"

    # create the project folder & pull contents from repo branch
    rm -rf $dest
    mkdir $dest
    cd $dest
    git init

    # optionally target a specific commit
    if [ "$3" != "" ]; then 
            git pull -f $repo.git $branch $3
    else
            git pull -f $repo.git $branch
    fi


    # fix writeable folders permissions
    chmod 777 ./data
    chmod 777 ./public/images

    # copy our local CodeIgniter config
    cd $htdocs
    cp -r ~/Desktop/application $dest/

    # find the first SQL script
    script=($(ls $dest/data/*.sql))
    if [ "$script" != "" ]; then
    #	# make sure the script doesn't try to create a database
    #	if [grep -Fxq "create database" "$script"]
    #	then
    #		exit 1
    #	else
    pwd
    echo "About to run script $script"
                    # execute that script to populate this project's database
                    $mysql/mysql -h localhost -P 3306 -S $socket -u $user -p$password -D $database < $script
    #	fi
    fi

    # open up the repo in a Firefox tab
    firefox $repo
    # and open up the app itself in another tab
    firefox comp4711.local
    # open the project in NetBeans
    $netbeans/netbeans --close-group --open $htdocs/$dest

You probably notice a couple of differences from the first script!

I can pull a specific branch, or even a specific commit inside that branch
(in case you keep working past the deadline).

This script also populates a Mysql database for you, with a name of my choosing.
There is some commented logic above to detect if you are naming the database to
use explicitly. The marking script is still a work in progress - at the moment, 
mistakes in your SQL script don't work, because the
mysql account I use when running this has very limited rights.

I choose the folder, port, virtual domain, database, and database
credentials to use. These are all deployment considerations.
I put these inside a configuration file, which defines variables to use above.
An example of this config...

    #----------------------------------------------------
    # Marking script configuration
    #----------------------------------------------------

    # htdocs folder
    htdocs=/pub7/htdocs
    # destination project/folder inside htdocs
    dest=comp4711
    # netbeans executable
    netbeans=/usr/local/netbeans-8.2/bin
    # mysql executable
    mysql=/opt/lampp/mysql/bin
    #mysql socket endpoint
    socket=/opt/lampp/mysql/tmp/mysql.sock

    # local MYSQL configuration
    user=marking
    password=secret
    database=bcitdb

## Remote Deployment

I have a remote deployment server, such that you can configure
a webhook for your repo, connected to an endpoint on my server. 
When a webhook event is triggered, and if that event is a merge for
the appropriate branch of a monitored repo, my app will
generate a configuration file and run a script similar to the long one above.

This is for testing your projects in a real (and Linux) setting.

If we opt to use it for this instance of the course,
each team will receive a "key" that they can use to access a project
configuration page on my server. You will specify the name of the repo
to monitor, and the branch for which a merge will trigger the
deployment.

This way, you can use it to test your `develop` branch, until ready to test your
`master` branch.

Once the assignment deadline arrives, I will disable the event handling
and pull all of your `master` branches for deployment on my server.
