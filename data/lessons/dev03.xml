            <p>Mick is the team leader. He needs to create an "organization" to
                use as a container for any projects the team wishes to collaborate on.</p>
            <p>The organization name is usually derived from the team name.
                Mick will use <code>rolling-stones</code> as their organization name.

            <p>Mick needs to create a repository inside the <code>rolling-stones</code>
                organization, to share with the team members.</p>
            <p>For this project, he will use the repository name <code>rock-quotes</code>.
                It will be public, so we don't have to pay, and he will have an initial README,
                .gitignore, and license.</p>
            <p>Only the maintainer of the official repository, Mick, can update it.
                That may include updates that break team member's repos, but that is "their"
                problem.</p>

            <p>Before anyone forks the project, Mick should get its initial state
                corrected. He should create a <code>develop</code> branch, and
                set the new branch as the default.
            </p>
            <p>The intent is that all work be done on the <code>develop</code>
                branch, with that being merged into the <code>master</code> branch
                only when the resulting codebase is in a stable state, for
                instance with a new release.

                inside their personal repository.
            </p>
            <p>Each team member will have their own project repository,

    <slide title="Some Useful Labels" layout="normal">
<!--        <div class="left">-->
            <p>Anything produced by a team member will end up in their
                repository until it is merged into the shared one.
                Until then, the member's repository is considered "ahead" of
                the shared one.</p>
            <p>If the shared repository contains other members' work that has not been merged
                into a team member's repository, their repository is considered
                "behind" the shared one.</p>
            <p>
                If the two repositories match, then the member's is said to be "even" with the shared one.</p>
            <p>A member's repository can be both ahead of and behind the shared one,
                for different pieces of code.</p>
