    <slide title="Routing" layout="normal">
        <p>Routing is the <b>process</b> of determining how to handle an incoming
            request. This can be done by explicit configuration, or "by
            convention".</p>
        <p>All frameworks support routing by <b>configuration</b>.
            CodeIgniter can also handle routing by <b>convention</b>,
            with controllers expected to be found inside
            <code>app/Controllers</code>
            without additional or specific configuration.</p>
        <p>Routing is essential to a framework. Many frameworks
            were started by figuring out the routing first, and then
            by designing and building components to support the
            routing and the "controllers" that would be the result
            of "doing" the routing.</p>

    <slide title="1. #URIsMatter" layout="normal" tag="tag1">
        <p>The form of a URI matters. It means different
            things in different contexts, as shown on the next
            few slides.</p>
        <p>The "generally accepted best practice" is to try to
            configure a webapp so that URIs are "SEO-friendly".
            That means they don't include the front controller
            (index.php) in their name, and that anything
            intended to identify a "resource" is part of
            the URI and not the query string.</p>
    </slide>


   <slide title="2. CodeIgniter Routing" layout="normal" tag="tag2">
        <p>To do routing, CodeIgniter...</p>
        <ol>
            <li>splits the URI into segments</li>
            <li>if the first segment is a folder identifier,
                drill down into it and repeat</li>
            <li>run through the routing rules, looking for a match</li>
            <li>treat the first segment as a controller name; bail if not</li>
            <li>if we have a controller, treat the second segment as a method
                name, defaulting to "index"</li>
            <li>if no segments, look for a default controller in
                the "current" folder</li>
            <li>if still not resolved, trigger a CI 404.</li>
        </ol>
                
    </slide>
    
    <slide title="Default Controllers" layout="normal">
        <p>One of the CodeIgniter configuration settings, in
            <code>app/Config/Routes.php</code>, is for the
            "default controller" ...<br/>
            <code>$routes->setDefaultController('Welcome');</code>
        </p>
        <p>This applies only if the first URI segment appears to identify a subfolder
            inside <code>app/Controllers</code>, and no routing rule 
            matches the incoming request; or if there is no controller
            segment in the URI.
        </p>
        <p>In such a case, the incoming request is interpreted with the "default
            controller" value added to the end, identifying the expected controller.</p>
        <p>If CodeIgniter can still not determine the appropriate controller to handle
            the request, it will return a CodeIgniter 404 error page.</p>

    <slide title="3. Routing Rules" layout="normal" tag="tag3">
        <p>
            Routing rules are configured in <code>app/Config/Routes.php</code>
        </p>
        <p>There is an incredible amount of flexibility with 
            <a href="https://codeigniter4.github.io/CodeIgniter4/incoming/routing.html" target="_blank">routing</a>, 
            but we only need a implified subset.</p>
        <p>
            <code>app/Controllers/Ordering.php</code> can define a normal controller or landing
            page for the customer ordering process, without having to define a route</p>
        <p>
            <code>app/Controllers/api/Book.php</code> might provide an API service controller
            for placing orders, without having to define a route.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>app/Controllers/Orders.php</code> can define a resource controller for orders,
            with a <a href="https://codeigniter4.github.io/CodeIgniter4/incoming/routing.html#resource-routes">resource routing</a> 
            rule: <code>$routes->resource('orders');</code>
        </p>
