Meet the framework we will be using, CodeIgniter 4.

We have a introduction presentation for it, and then
you will be completing the CodeIgniter 4 tutorial in lab.

This week, you will learn about controllers and routing.
We have a simple lab for you to practice those.

Tuesday, I would like to spend the first half completing lab 4,
and the second half of the lab getting you started on
Assignment 1.
