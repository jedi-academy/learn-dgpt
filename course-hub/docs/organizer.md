# Course Organizer

`data/organizer.xml` controls what your students see as the
course material for your course.

The sample one provided with this repo is meant to be an
example of a reasonable organizer, incorporating all the
different elements that you might want to use in your courses.

## Constraints

The `organizer.xml` is constrained by a DTD, `data/xml/organizer.dtd`.
It has descriptions of the usable elements and attributes inside your
organizer.

Your `organizer.xml` can be validated using it.

## Sections

The course is organized into sections, using `week` elements.

If your course has more than one meeting a week, and you wish
to present them separately, this would be suitable.
A planned enhancement is to make this more flexible, to support
multiple meetings in a week, and to use a better element name for
these sections.
