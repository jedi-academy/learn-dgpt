## Course description
This course provides the students with an opportunity to develop a software application 
that works across the internet. An overview of various internet software development 
technologies is provided. Students will learn how to build a web application using a 
modern webapp MVC framework and Apache server technology; and how to use XML for 
data representation, structure and transport.

## Course goals
This course is about webapp development, using best practices.  
In small teams, the students will build a moderate MVC webapp in three phases, each building on the previous one.  
The teams will collaborate using a shared code repository and gitflow workflow, with appropriate supporting tools.  

*Detailed learning outcomes*:  
1  Build a moderate MVC web application using a suitable framework.  
	1.1  Setup a suitable webapp development environment  
	1.2  Build a basic MVC webapp  
	1.3  Build a moderately complex webapp  
2  Build distributed capabilities into an MVC web application  
	2.1  Use common representation protocols for distributed systems  
	2.2  Use common transport protocols for distributed systems  
	2.3  Use common application protocols for distributed systems  
3  Demonstrate proper team collaboration for webapp development  
	3.1  Use collaborative workflow to develop a webapp  
	3.2  Use a shared code repository to develop a webapp  

## Course learning outcomes / competencies
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:  
 1  Construct an MVC web application using a suitable framework.  
 2  Construct a valid and well-formed XML document, and constrain it with a DTD.  
 3  Process XML data using DOM.  

## Evaluation criteria
Quizzes & participation - 10% ... Readings & lab attendance (motivation)  
Labs - 30% ... 9 walkthrough labs (guidance)  
Assignments - 40% ... 3 assignments (practice)  
Final exam - 20% ... Multiple choice & short answer (assessment)

## Attendance requirements
Students missing more than two labs will receive an Unsatisfactory grade in the course, and fail.

## Learning resources
* PHP and HTML/CSS aware editor; eg [NetBeans 8](http://www.netbeans.org) or [PhpStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm)  
* AMP (Apache + MySQL + PHP) server environment, suitable for the student's platform; eg  [xAMP stack](http://bitnami.com)  
* CodeIgniter 3 webapp framework, [free download[(http://codeigniter.com)  

## Course specific requirements

The expected workload for this course is one hour out-of-class for each timetabled hour. The expectation is that a student will spend one hour on the assigned reading and related quiz/questionnaire, and two hours collaborating on their assignment(s).

Weekly readings will be assigned, starting with the second week, following a “flipped” learning model.  Students are to read these lessons and answer a quiz/questionnaire, by the evening before that week's “lecture”. The “lecture” will address unclear topics, per the students' responses, and discuss industry issues relevant to that week's topics.

Some labs are individual, while others will use pair programming. Pairings will be randomly assigned, within a block. Most of these will have starter projects, on github. The usual submission, if needed, will be a readme file in a D2L dropbox, containing a link to the students' github repository they used to complete the work. Lab grading will be by rubric, and the two members of a pair do not have to receive the same grade. Lab work is meant to be completed during the lab period, with time available to apply the lab's outomes to the students' assignments.

Assignments will be completed in student-selected project teams of 3-5 members, from the same block. The same team will be used for all assignments. If a student does not have a team, they will be assigned one by the instructor. Teams of one or of two members are not acceptable. Team members' grades are commensurate with their contribution, as well as performance assessed by an assignment rubric. Team submissions will be in the form of a readme file in a D2L dropbox, with a link to the team's github repository for their project.

Course materials (lessons, examples, tutorials, labs and assignments) will be shared through D2L content and/or a public website (the course “hub”). Lab and assignment feedback will be provided through the D2L dropboxes that readme files are submitted to. The D2L gradebook will be useful only to review D2L-captured grade components, and it will not provide an accurate final grade in the course.

Students who miss class for an acceptable reason will be excused from attendance and quiz/questionnaire completion, should those fall during the excused period. Missed readings or lab work will need to be made up by the student.
