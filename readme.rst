Programming Style
*****************

Some of the programming design decisions reflected:

-   The architecture adheres more to the "model-view-adapter" convention,
    where the view is unaware of the source of data and the model is unaware of
    how any data might be presented. The controllers are go-betweens.
-   A "theme template" presents the organizing pages for a course, in a
    visual style consistent with the main CodeIgniter site.
-   A "show template" presents a learning activity as a slideshow suited
    to presentation or print, using the S5 framework from Eric Meyer.
-   A base controller takes care of assembling finished pages, using the 
    master template.
-   Using the template parser eliminates PHP code from the views, where possible.
-   View fragments are used to style single "records" on their own, improving cohesion.
-   An ".htaccess" file is incorporated, to configure Apache to remote
    index.php from any URLs.
-   The site is XML-driven, abstracting as much as possible so that the
    webapp can be used for other courses. XML was chosen over an RDB
    because of the rich data structures it can support.
